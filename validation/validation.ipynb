The term \"related work\" appears in various contexts, including what individuals did or whose work was being referred to. Since both aspects (wording issues and related work) are covered within discussions by witnesses, the topic seems accurate.\n",

Then it mentions that any witnesses were under oath and that there's a verbatim record transcribed by machine. There's also certification about not being financially interested or related, and some date details at the bottom.\n",

      "The topic says Affidavit of John Purcell - Heather Turrey vs. Vervent, Inc. The name \"John Purcell\" isn't in the excerpt provided. So unless there's an implication that he is part of this process (like being the stenographer), but looking at line 24 and 25, they mention a signature with <%15225,Signature%> and CSR No. 13558.

      "Looking at the transcript: The question asks about experience with student loans, and the answer refers to cases under that context as the primary expertise. Then it specifically says, \"A small handful of times. Less than half a -- less than half a dozen.\" There's no explicit mention of time, but maybe I can infer something from this.\n",
      "  \n",
      "The key part is when the witness talks about doing these student loan-related cases and describes them as happening in the last five to ten years? No, that doesn't seem right. The answer just says \"a small handful\" or \"less than half a dozen,\" which implies limited experience but doesn't specify any time frame like recent years.\n",
      "  \n",
      "The topic is supposed to be about clarifying timeframe specifically for the last five to ten years. But in this excerpt, there's no timeframe mentioned at all. The witness isn't saying anything about when they did these cases; it just seems present-focused without dates or durations given.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Now, I need to consider what makes a topic relevant. If an extracted topic can be directly supported by the text—like if there were words in the transcript that explicitly talk about time—it would be relevant. But here, the transcript doesn't have any such details; it's just stating expertise and frequency without dates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "There might be some unstated context or assumption involved. Maybe the assistant thinks that \"these cases\" implies they're recent because depositions are current events? Or perhaps there's an implication from the way things are phrased, but I don't see any direct evidence for a timeframe being clarified here.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Let me double-check the transcript: It starts with \"Q Have you ever had any experience with that in the context of student loans?\" Then A says it's primary expertise, so these cases likely refer to recent ones. But when talking about how many times, there's no mention of time period—just a small number.\n",
      "  \n",
      "So even though it might be implied that the experience is recent (since depositions are ongoing), there isn't any clarification or specific timeframe stated in the excerpt itself.

      "The committee's review might include factors affecting both enrollment continuation and eventual degree attainment. So even though they're reviewing retention rates, which are more about staying enrolled, that could still be relevant to understanding why some students didn't get degrees.

      "The question asks if the topic \"Defendant denies public awareness of wrongdoing\" is relevant to this excerpt. First, I need to understand what's happening in the text. There's a lawyer asking the defendant if they are aware of any findings of wrongdoing by the Vervent defendants related to the CFPB investigation. The defendant clarifies that they're not publicly aware of any such findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The topic mentions \"public awareness\" and \"denies.\" In the transcript, the defendant says they don't know about any public findings, which aligns with denying being aware through official or public channels. Even though the lawyer asks if they are privately aware, the defendant doesn't answer that part directly but sticks to not knowing publicly available information.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the main focus of the defendant's response is on public awareness. They're stating a lack of knowledge about findings made by the CFPB which are documented and accessible. The topic specifically refers to denying public awareness, so it matches because the defendant is addressing the absence of public findings. Even though there might be an implication about private knowledge, the explicit answer given is about public findings not being known.\n",

      "Okay, let's start by looking at the user query again. They provided a transcript snippet where the witness is being questioned about unenforceable PEAKS loans, but there's an interruption from Mr. Blood saying it's vague because it seeks a legal conclusion outside their scope. The topic they extracted was \"Witness clarifies review scope: Vervent document access.\" I need to determine if this topic is relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the key elements in the excerpt are the witness's response about being asked to repeat due to confusion or unclear question, then Mr. Blood's objection for vagueness and legal conclusion. The witness explains their scope of review was limited to certain documents or tasks, not broader legal issues like enforceability. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the extracted topic mentions \"Vervent document access.\" Hmm, that might be a typo—probably meant \"Veritext\" as per the transcript line with Veritext Legal Solutions. So adjusting the topic slightly: the witness clarifies their review scope regarding certain documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original excerpt's main point is about the witness explaining they weren't asked to review for legal conclusions like unenforceability, but rather a specific task related to document access (likely transcription services). The topic focuses on \"Vervent document access,\" which seems incorrect. Assuming it's Veritext as in the transcript line, then yes—the witness is indeed clarifying their scope by mentioning they were reviewing documents provided by Veritext or something similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, does the excerpt mention anything about Vervent? No, that might be a mistake. The user probably meant to use \"Veritext\" from the transcript's line number. So if we correct that, then the topic is relevant because the witness refers to their review scope in relation to documents (likely those provided by Veritext). The interruption about vagueness and legal conclusion supports this—Mr. Blood wants a specific answer on whether there was access or something similar, which falls outside the witness's duty.\n",

      "Okay, let's see. So I have this excerpt from a deposition transcript where someone named Ms. Yu is being asked about what she means by the term \"outlier\". The witness starts to explain that ITT was a notoriously bad institution with flagrant misrepresentations regarding education quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, the topic given is \"Witness identifies numerous false education claims - Ms. Yu\". Now I need to check if this topic relates to the excerpt provided. Let's break it down. The key elements here are: witness (Ms. Yu) and she identifies false education claims. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the transcript, Ms. Yu does mention that ITT used flagrant misrepresentations about education quality. That definitely points to false or misleading claims regarding their educational services. So her statement is identifying instances of such misrepresentation, which aligns with \"false education claims\" in the topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the term \"outlier\" isn't directly explained here. The question was about that term, and she started explaining it by talking about ITT being bad and having misrepresented their quality. However, without her defining what an outlier is specifically to those claims, maybe there's a missing link. But since the topic says she identifies numerous false education claims, and her response does include identifying such claims (even if briefly), that seems relevant. The question was about \"outlier\", but her answer shifts focus to ITT being bad with misrepresentations. So perhaps the connection is implied through context?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the reporter interrupts because they lost her after \"flagrant\". But she clarifies and continues explaining ITT's issues. Even if she didn't get to fully define \"outlier\" in that excerpt, she did address part of it by talking about false claims. The topic doesn't require a direct mention of \"outlier\", just that the witness identifies false education claims. Since Ms. Yu brought up those misrepresentations as part of her testimony related to ITT, which is probably what \"outlier\" refers to in this context (since she's trying to explain why it was an outlier), then yes, the topic applies.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it together: The excerpt shows Ms. Yu identifying false claims by ITT about education quality during a deposition. That matches the given topic.\n",

      "First, looking at the content of the excerpt. The speaker talks about initiatives they've been involved in, specifically mentioning advocating for President Biden to cancel student loan debt and writing extensively on income-driven repayment (IDR). They mention that some of their recommendations were incorporated into the Department of Education's most recent draft regarding IDR rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "The topic mentions a discussion about income-driven repayment rules. The excerpt does include the witness discussing IDR policies, how they advocated for them, and their recommendations being part of a draft by the DOE.

      "Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user provided an excerpt from a deposition transcript and asks if it's related to \"Certified Shorthand Reporter Certification - California Deposition\". My task is to determine relevance based on the content.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll look at the excerpt. It starts with \"I, PERSIS YU, do solemnly declare under penalty of perjury...\" This is a standard oath taken by someone in a deposition. The deposition transcript usually has these kinds of statements where the witness swears to tell the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next part says she subscribes her name this day of [blank], 2023. There's a blank for the date, and there's space for a signature below. This is typical for any legal document requiring certification by an individual, not specific to shorthand reporters or California.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mention of Veritext Legal Solutions and their contact info at the bottom suggests this is part of a deposition service provider's information. That doesn't relate to certified shorthand reporter certification either. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, considering the topic: Certified Shorthand Reporter Certification involves officially trained court reporters who transcribe proceedings verbatim under stenographic methods. The excerpt here doesn’t mention any certification process or the role of a certified shorthand reporter. Instead, it focuses on an individual (Persis Yu) swearing to the truthfulness of her deposition answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also check if there's anything in the excerpt about legal transcription standards, the RMR/CRCSR certifications, or specific California deposition regulations. There isn't any mention of these details here. The key elements are the oath and the person signing it as a witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, this excerpt is more about the basic certification required for testimony rather than detailing the process to become a certified shorthand reporter. It doesn’t provide information on how such certification is obtained or its requirements in California.\n",

      "First, I need to check if the excerpt mentions anything about cancellation attempts. Looking at lines 5-6: \"...within which a borrower may have attempted to cancel their loans and...\" So yes, there's direct mention of borrowers attempting cancellations in that context. The topic includes both \"Borrower loan cancellation attempt\" and \"Witness testimony,\" which matches the excerpt since it's part of what the witness is saying during cross-examination.\n",

They need an efficient way to determine relevance without reading each line fully.

      "Okay, let's see. The user provided a deposition transcript excerpt where there's a question about whether Vervent needed certain disclosures as per Access Group's work. The witness initially says they were reviewing specific documents related to that but doesn't directly answer the regulation part. Then the attorney objects it's vague, and the witness asks to think about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The topic given is \"Vervent disclosure regulation inquiry - Witness unclear.\" So I need to check if this accurately reflects the excerpt. The main issue here is whether Vervent had a legal obligation under some regulation for those disclosures mentioned by Access Group. The witness's response isn't clear—they were asked to review documents included in the defendants' set, but they don't confirm if there was such a regulation requiring them to do so. They even ask for clarification or time to think about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The topic seems relevant because the core of the question is whether Vervent had to disclose certain things regulated by some rule, and the witness's answer isn't definitive enough. The attorney's intervention (objection) also points out that the witness was unsure, which aligns with the \"unclear\" part in the topic. So yes, the topic captures both the regulation aspect and the uncertainty from the witness.\n",

      "First, I need to understand what the excerpt contains. The key lines here are from 18 onwards: MR. BLOOD says he misstates prior testimony and asks for it again, then MR. PURCELL responds after being told to go ahead. \n",
      "\n",
      "The topic mentions a request for repetition by Mr. Purcell. But in the excerpt, when the reporter tells someone to go ahead, it's actually Mr. Purcell who speaks next, confirming his question about needing the witness to repeat prior testimony (line 18). However, MR. BLOOD is the one requesting the repetition (\"I need that line again there\") and then addressing Mr. Purcell. \n",
      "\n",
      "So even though the topic specifies Mr. Purcell as the counselor making the request, in reality it's Mr. Blood who does so. The transcript shows a different sequence: first the request by Blood, followed by Purcell responding to confirm his question. There is no direct instance of Purcell asking for repetition himself.\n",

      "Okay, let's see what this query is about. They provided a deposition transcript excerpt and asked if the topic \"Request to review and modify testimony - Witness 1, Witness 2\" is relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the excerpt. It seems like two witnesses are being addressed in lines 5-8. The lawyer mentions that after the deposition, one can review their answers but cannot change them later unless they were determined by someone else (maybe a third party) beforehand? Wait, line 9 says \"Do you have an opinion as to whether...\" so maybe the question is about PEAKS loans being unenforceable. The lawyer clarifies that if changes are needed, it should be done before the deposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, does this relate to requesting to review and modify testimony? In lines 1-4, the lawyer talks about reviewing after deposition but not allowing modifications unless there was a prior determination. Line 9 asks Witness 2 (since the numbering starts from 02:26 under W2?) if they have an opinion on PEAKS loans being unenforceable. Wait, actually looking at line numbers, maybe each number corresponds to a speaker? But the transcript shows \"W1\" and then jumps to \"Okay.\" which might be the lawyer's response. Then in lines 5-8 it continues with the lawyer speaking again, but the numbering is consecutive from W2 onwards? Hmm, could there be confusion here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, Witness 2 (or maybe both?) are being asked about their opinion on whether PEAKS loans were unenforceable. The topic mentions a request to review and modify testimony by Witnesses 1 and 2. In the excerpt, the lawyer is indicating that after deposition, you can review but not change unless it was determined earlier. So Witness 2 might be being asked if their opinion changed or something? Or maybe they're supposed to confirm what's already been said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key point is whether there's a discussion about modifying testimony post-deposition. The lawyer says modifications are allowed only if done before the deposition, otherwise no changes after it. Then asks W2 for an opinion on PEAKS loans. So while W2 is being asked their opinion (which relates to legal enforceability), that doesn't directly involve reviewing or modifying existing testimony unless they were part of prior determinations. The request in the topic seems to be about changing what was already said, but according to the lawyer, you can review but not change after deposition unless something else happened beforehand. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the excerpt isn't explicitly discussing a scenario where W1 and W2 ask for permission to modify their testimony post-deposition. Instead, it's clarifying that modifications aren't allowed afterward unless they occurred before this point. So the topic of \"requesting to review and modify\" doesn't appear in the provided text—W1 has already given testimony (as per lines 5-8), but there's no mention from them wanting to change or request for modification.\n",

So the key actions are marking the exhibit and asking for a slower pace during testimony.\n",

      "The topic says \"Witness requests slower pace,\" but actually, it's the attorney (Mr. Purcell) who is requesting the witness to slow down, not the other way around. The excerpt doesn't have the witness making any request; instead, they're complying by being in front of their report, and the attorney makes the note about slowing down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, \"marks exhibit - Terrific.\" Well, the attorney marks it as an exhibit, but there's no mention of the word \"terrific\" except that the attorney says \"Terrific.\" Maybe that part is just emphasis from the attorney. The main point is the marking and the request for slower pace. \n",
      "\n",
      "So does this topic capture everything? It misses that the witness was reading initially, which prompted the need to slow down.

      "The topic given is \"SEC concerns regarding borrower payment issues - Witness.\" So it's about the SEC having concerns related to how payments were handled for borrowers. The witness in the excerpt mentions that the SEC did raise issues with those payments, which aligns with the topic. Even though the witness isn't sure if Vervent was specifically called out, they do confirm there were SEC concerns regarding borrower payments.\n",
